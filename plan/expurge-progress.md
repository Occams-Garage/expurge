# expurge — build progress

---

## What exists today

**M0–M6 is complete and buildable.** The codebase supports multi-broker paced
batching, AKA name-variant fan-out, and a full options-page UI. One broker
(TruePeopleSearch), up to BATCH_SIZE=5 concurrent tabs, `also_known_as[]`
expansion, serial write queue, badge, options dashboard with Run/Results/Profile/Settings
sections, redesigned popup (run-control-panel only). No persistence opt-ins.

### Files in place

| File | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `manifest.json` | MV3, Firefox 140+, data-taxonomy declaration; permissions: storage/tabs/downloads/scripting/webNavigation (webNavigation declared for `onErrorOccurred`, not yet wired in background); host_permissions: updates.expurge.dev (M7 remote fetch); optional_host_permissions: TruePeopleSearch; `options_ui.open_in_tab: true`; `_notes` block documents M7/M9 requirements (strip before AMO submission) |

| `src/shared/types.ts` | Verdict, WorkItem (tabId scratch-only, matchedAs on hit, optedOutAt on send), RunState, Profile (all 10 fields), all message types including SAVE_PROFILE/GET_PROFILE/MARK_SENT/DELETE_ALL |
| `src/shared/brokers.ts` | ChannelTrust enum, BrokerChannel/Broker interfaces, BROKERS const (TruePeopleSearch only; trust stubbed as 'verified') |
| `src/shared/transforms.ts` | Four transforms (slug/q/upper/raw), deriveFields(), renderUrl() |
| `src/shared/gate.ts` | evaluateGate(), channelExpiryState(), WARN_MONTHS=6, EXPIRE_MONTHS=12 |
| `src/shared/templates.ts` | Draft discriminated union (EmailDraft \| FormDraft); buildDraft() dispatches on channel.kind; buildFormCard() generates form instruction card; mailtoUrl/toEml/toCopyText on EmailDraft; US general + CA CCPA templates (copy TBD Q-010) |
| `src/background/index.ts` | Stateless coordinator; serialWrite queue (prevents TOCTOU); saveRun() strips tabIds; expurge_tab_{tabId} session keys; handles START_RUN/GET_RUN_STATE/GET_ITEM/VERDICT/GET_DRAFT/STOP_RUN/REINJECT_OVERLAY/SAVE_PROFILE/GET_PROFILE/MARK_SENT/DELETE_ALL; onInstalled → openOptionsPage(); buildItems() fans out across primary + AKA variants, pre-verdicts missing-field items; matchedAs populated on hit; updateBadge() (hit count); handleStopRun() marks open+pending as run_stopped + removes tab keys; findActiveBrokerTab() with mid-redirect fallback; tabs.onUpdated hostname guard (skips off-host reinject); tabs.onRemoved → tab_closed |

| `src/options/index.ts` | Full options page TypeScript: init() → GET_PROFILE + GET_RUN_STATE → routes new users to Profile; renderRunActive() 2s poll; renderResults() with four verdict groups; loadDraftPanel() → GET_DRAFT → renderEmailDraftInPanel / renderFormDraftInPanel; MARK_SENT; SAVE_PROFILE on form submit; saveSendMethod to storage.local; DELETE_ALL; export JSON via downloads API; handleStartRun() with dynamic permissions.request() |

### Prototype vs. target architecture

The popup currently contains the profile form and draft surfaces. Per the design interview,
these move to the options page in M4+. The popup becomes a compact run control panel only.

### Planned: overlay → sidebar migration (decided 2026-07-01, not yet built)

The shipped in-page shadow-DOM overlay (`src/content/index.ts`) and its Restore-Overlay /
PING / reinjection machinery are slated for replacement by a Firefox native **sidebar** — a
persistent run-wide checklist that drives navigation. Adds a first-class `deferred` work-item
state, a `MAX_OPEN_TABS=15` ceiling, per-broker `search.guidance`, and shrinks the content
script to a headless challenge reporter. Full plan in **`plan/sidebar-nav.md`**; rationale in
wherefore `2026-07-01-sidebar-run-navigation` (resolves Q-013, opens Q-015). The `content` /
`popup` / `background` rows above document the **current** overlay build, not the target.

## Milestones

### Done

- **M0** — Manifest + build skeleton (esbuild, TS, webextension-polyfill, dist/)
- **M1** — Profile form → URL render → open tab (popup form, permissions.request, START_RUN)
- **M2** — Content script overlay + four-way verdict + ACK contract (shadow DOM, retry logic, tab_closed skip)
- **M3** — Draft gate + three send surfaces (evaluateGate, buildDraft, mailto/.eml/copy-paste in popup)
- **M3+** — Listing URL capture: results-page guidance panel, navigate-to-details flow, paste fallback, post-ACK "open expurge" cue, listingUrl in draft body
- **M3+** — TPS form_required opt-out: corrected channel record, Draft discriminated union, buildFormCard(), form card in popup (fields table, 7-step walkthrough, open-form button)
- **M4** — Single-broker robustness: challenge detection (10 selectors covering Cloudflare/Turnstile/hCaptcha/reCAPTCHA/DataDome; MutationObserver auto-transitions to verdict panel on solve; Skip button sends skipped verdict); stop control (STOP_RUN marks all open+pending as run_stopped; popup stop button hidden on completion); no-wedge verified across all three clearing paths (verdict, skip, tab-closed all call openNextBatch); Restore overlay fixed (findActiveBrokerTab walks session keys to find live broker tab, switches to it; falls back to opening next pending item; correct dist/content.js inject path)
- **M5** — Multi-broker batching + AKA fan-out: buildItems() expands primary + also_known_as[] variants across all active brokers (one item per broker × name-variant); missing required field → pre-verdicted skip with `missing:<field>` reason; serialWrite queue prevents TOCTOU races when multiple browser tabs return verdicts concurrently; matchedAs field populated on hit verdict; browser.action badge shows hit count; popup run monitor renders per-broker table with rolled-up status badge + AKA count; coverage note shows brokers not in the run and missing-field skip count; PING listener guarded by window flag (deduplicates across executeScript reinjections); MutationObserver dismissal debounced 250 ms; challenge skip button checks sendVerdict return value
- **M6** — Options page (primary UI) + popup redesign: `options_ui.open_in_tab: true`; `onInstalled` → `openOptionsPage()`; four-section options page (Run / Results / Profile / Settings) with 2s polling, run state machine, all 10 Profile fields, verdict groups with inline draft panels, `general_contact` amber callout, mark-as-sent (`optedOutAt`), preferred send method in `storage.local`, broker coverage list, export, delete-all; popup stripped to run-control-panel (open dashboard / restore overlay / stop); Profile type expanded to 10 fields; SAVE_PROFILE/GET_PROFILE/MARK_SENT/DELETE_ALL message handlers in background

### Remaining

#### M7 — Signed remote dataset (Ed25519)
- Keypair generation + key management docs
- `TRUSTED_PUBKEYS` constant baked into build (primary + backup)
- `crypto.subtle.verify` on fetch; reject-and-fallback on signature failure
- Remote fetch UI: "Check for updates" button in Settings → Broker list
- Auto-fetch: lazy-triggered when options page opens and ≥ 7 days elapsed
- First-fetch consent prompt in Profile section (copy TBD Q-006)
- New-domain permission request flow after verified dataset arrives
- Bundled dataset signed and shipped with extension

#### M8 — Persistence opt-ins
- Three independent toggles in Settings → Storage (all default OFF):
  1. Profile storage → `storage.local` (enables cross-session run resume)
  2. Run metadata (per-broker last-checked + result, no PII)
  3. Rich hits/drafts history (rides profile opt-in)
- Contextual first-exposure banners (Run done → run-metadata opt-in; Results → rich-history opt-in; Profile → profile-storage opt-in)
- Background: loadRun() / saveRun() promote to `storage.local` when profile-storage opt-in is active; cross-session resume on reopen
- Export: JSON (no draft bodies, raw data only), download via downloads API
- Import: read JSON, warn-and-overwrite if profile exists (no merge)
- Delete-all: inline single-confirmation panel, wipes all `storage.local` expurge keys

#### M9 — Full dataset + launch polish
- ~25 verified people-search brokers in brokers.json (all channels personally verified, trust bits stamped)
- Pre-launch verify: CCPA template legal language; DROP registry cross-reference (Q-010)
- CI schema validator: rejects malformed records, enforces trust-bit hygiene (contributed records must be `trust: unverified`)
- Optional stamp helper: `verify <broker-id> <channel>` CLI sets last_checked / verified_by / trust
- Full run on real brokers, bugs fixed
- AMO submission prep: screenshots, description, privacy notice, data-practices declaration

## Open design questions

| ID | Status | Question |
|----|--------|----------|
| Q-003 | open | Can a content/background script reach a localhost Ollama endpoint? (v2 concern) |
| Q-006 | partial | Weekly lazy cadence resolved; **exact consent-prompt copy still needs legal review** |
| Q-010 | open | CCPA template legal language + DROP registry overlap — pre-launch verify required |

---

## Known code TODOs

| Location | TODO |
|----------|------|
| `src/shared/brokers.ts` | TruePeopleSearch form channel verified 2026-06-28 — re-verify periodically; only one broker total (M9 expands to ~25) |
| `src/shared/templates.ts` | Both email template bodies marked `// TODO Q-010` — legal review before launch |
| `src/shared/templates.ts` | `buildFormCard()` fields are TPS-specific (role dropdown step, hCaptcha step); generalize when adding more form_required brokers |
| `src/background/index.ts` | AKA parsing splits on first space only — "Mary Jane Smith" gives first="Mary", last="Jane Smith"; smarter parsing (e.g. last-space split) deferred |
| `src/options/index.ts` | Settings section has no import JSON (export only); import deferred to M8 alongside persistence opt-ins |
| `src/background/index.ts` | `webNavigation` is declared in manifest permissions but `browser.webNavigation.onErrorOccurred` is not yet wired — add when M9 broker set makes load-error detection meaningful |

## Consciously deferred (code review, 2026-06-28 / 2026-06-29)

These findings were surfaced in code reviews and explicitly deferred rather than
fixed. Recorded here so the decision isn't re-litigated in future sessions.

| Finding | Deferred to | Rationale |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| `buildFormCard()` steps are TPS-specific (role dropdown, hCaptcha step) | M9 | Generalise when a second `form_required` broker is added; premature abstraction with one data point |
| Background PING handler always returns `hasOverlay: false` | — | Content script is authoritative for overlay presence; background stub is harmless; options page REINJECT_OVERLAY flow does not depend on this value |
| SPA / History API navigation not handled (overlay disappears on client-side route change) | M9 | No current broker in the set is a SPA; revisit when adding brokers that use pushState |
| REINJECT_OVERLAY fallback opens exactly 1 tab regardless of BATCH_SIZE (duplication of `openNextBatch`) | M7 | Acceptable with one broker; replace with `openOrRecoverBatch()` when the full broker set ships |
| Settings import JSON | M8 | Export is present; import deferred to M8 alongside the persistence opt-in toggles it depends on |
